Wasted my 1st 90 minute focus this a.m., but did acquire info on wood sculpture. Got some metal moved and chicken manure also. Made 2nd worm bin. Girls stopped by on their way to NC and walked mile plus. After using the tractor this afternoon, my left knee hurts quite a bit. Have to go easy tomorrow.
Did a lot or research on tractor palette bars and tie downs. Looks like it's a good way to make the tractor more functional,

Also did a lot of cleaning up the computer. Ran clean software and did some deleting of non-used items. Hard to know what to delete thourh because it's impossible to tell what the agents do. Finally got rid of the google sync software and its related files. Computer still takes a long time to boot up. Still more to do.

Turns out I did more than I should today. Knee and back hurt in the evening, especially after sitting down. Used heat and standing up as treatment.

Need to get onto my 90 min. focus regime tomorrow.

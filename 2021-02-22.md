Started off well. Did Stairs (they're going to be very useful.)and 5 pups then walked a mile (incorporated 3 jogs of Pat's fence section). Got to thinking about Linda without her phone and decided to take it up to her in case she needed it.  Went up to Milford and found she hadn't missed it. Was well received by Maisie and read a book with George during his speech persons class. Left to their dismay to come home to work on Obsidian.[[^]]
Worked through and noted [[Navigation Notes]] some videos by Heureka (Matt?)[[Heureka Labs]] and Nick Milo on  tags and block references and plug ins. Still thinking about the possibilities in using an Obsidian like approach with kids. It may be more developmentally and neurologically appropriate. Just thinking about how to implement an educational program in this vein.

^Have G. make observations about our adventure and/or nature related facts and put in Obsidian to build up concepts. Also could build on his present knowledge of dinosaurs. Have him relate facts and build up from there. Montesorri did something like this, but relied on the kids having physical experiences with a limited set of objects. This approach would be to relate to natural objects or knowledge already in the kids PKB (Personal Knowledge Bank.) With structure it could also be used to expand kids' horizontal decalage.[[human development and eudcation]]

>Rain again keeping me indoors, but made calls to check on orders for Fri. blood work and Dentist to be put on standby since appt is in Sept.

So now I have 2.5 projects (the .5 is to learn Obsidian while doing the other two):
	A new approach to education using Obsidian 
	A personal evaluation of  our culture and it's effects. "culture is not what we say it is what we do"

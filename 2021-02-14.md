Spent the morning catching up on mail and following leads and develping the Obsidian data base. From Popova to considering the interrelatedness of everything. Shane Parrish interview with Loch Kelley who view enlightenment as a developmental stage. Ordering needed things from Amazon, reading mail, checking the weather and watching the fallout from the Trump impeachment trial through Twitter feeds. Following up on my to-do list.

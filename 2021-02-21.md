Up before 8:00 with quotes and memories triggered by Krista Tippett's podcast this morning with [Ariel Burger:Be a Blessing](https://onbeing.org/programs/ariel-burger-be-a-blessing/)
Was excited to find [[Heureka Labs]] a combinatiion of learning obsidian and writing. I need to spend some time here.
Getting on with my day. Hang out wash, get bulbs from Lowes, etc. Still cold out, but will try to finish some of my outside projects.
Am excited more with the prospects of obsidian and getting my thoughts together.
Was thinking early about what it is I would like to teach/model for the grandkids. Will need to work on this. One thing for starters is to think from the ground up as in the manner in which obsidian can be used and not hierarchical as in the way schooling is practiced and knowledge is organized for schooling.

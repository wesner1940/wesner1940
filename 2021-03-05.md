Started today with a notation about drugs in early Christianity. It would seem obvious in retrospect that psychedelics would have been used with all the emphasis on the sacraments and other symbols. The emaphasis on miracles would also be evidence.
Had an episode of dizziness yesterday afternoon. Am not sure why. Was working for several hours on the computer, but also may have been due to caffeine. Will have to watch for that.
Working on a way to get all my Evernote notes into obsidian. Looks like using Joplin may be the way, but will take a long time.
Explored neuracache on iphone. may have possibilities. ![[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nIie_CtU3E]]

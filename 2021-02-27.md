Am not sure where my thinking is taking me these days. I think back to my 26 year old self, fresh back from Vietnam, cynical, lucky to be alive, and pissed off. Ran into Michael Parenti this morning on my youtube feed...hmmm, is AI shaping my future. Also listen to Brett Weinstein and Tristan Harris on the role of the tech companies in shaping our culture. I view this as yet another example of the tragedy of the commons. The companies profit from the manipulation of our consciousness, but people in general suffer from loss of freedom and worse the debasement of the culture, individually and collectively.

"Conservatives" it is what they say it is Bill Kristol, conceding to the CPAC embrace of Trump. This may be, but I think it is important to define what it is conservatives believe, what it stands for, what its policies are. Force them out and contrast with the same for former conservatives. I think this exercise would produce the realization that the new "conservatives" are a religion with all the narratives that that entails.

Got my new keyboard set up done. Looks like it's going to solve my keystroking problem.

Got a lot done today in terms of organizing outside projects. Still have to identify and drag out the metal I'll be taking to Milford. Surprising how good it feels to get organized again although I've got a long way to go.

I need to set up a Home page and MOC's for projects in Obsidian

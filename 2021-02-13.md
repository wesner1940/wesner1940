Out for an early walk on the trail. Cold, but tolerable. Typical winter day with snow or cold rain forecast. It's interesting what you can see and find if you pay attention.

Some other thoughts from the walk:
Listening to Brit Weinstein and Daniel Smachtenberger...need to download Air and try to take notes with it.

Thought about the underlying process of thinking with Obsidian, [[bottom up]] and how it could be a metaphor for education. If we trained children to use this way of thinking and gave them the tools to relate things this would certainly be a better way to educate (as opposed to the current top down method). In fact, in the above podcast Smachtenberger was relating how his education was... no formal schooling but a great deal of support from his parents. Sounds sort of like a John Dewey model.

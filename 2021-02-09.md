- Reviewed [[Justin Dirose's process]]Justin Duross' with Keep Productive this a.m.
Interesting that He and Nick Milo stress the use of Obsidian as a bottom up (as opposed to  imposed structure or beginning outline) approach to note taking and knowledge management. I'm thinking that the same might be true for writing as well. So rather than started with an outline or plot, you could develop the story organically by sketching characters, creating mini scenes, jumping ahead and or back, etc.
- Another use for a KMS for me would be to gather all my experiences and write them down...kind of a "looking backward"
- Thought also of creating a podcast for "older folks"...haven't seen anything like that. Just saw some lists, but none seem to have a "what's it like to be old" flavor. Maybe an interview format.
- Something to think about.pee power {{https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/02/phosphorus-pollution-fertilizer/617937/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=atlantic-daily-newsletter&utm_content=20210208&silverid-ref=NTQzNDgwNzAzMDI4S0}}

Off to walk with Bob this a.m. Foggy day. Had wine last night, slips... Sleep not too good. Woke at 12, then again at 3:30. Didn't get much sleep after then. Caffeine?
Got taxes ready to send out.
Was listening to an Atlantic article by Anne Appelbaum and heard Karl Popper's name again after seeing references to him in[[Alison Gopnick]] or [[David Deutsch]] yesterday. He was portrayed as the advocate of the open society. Interesting how these references keep coming up, probably that I'm reading in a certain vein.
Need to work on getting past references and articles into Obsidian. Had moved them to Notion, so I was able to copy the Notion docs and paste them into Obsidian.,
Fairly long walk with Bob, probably 2.25-2.5
Found new technique today, using a Chrome extension to create MD files. Could then copy the file in Obsidian.

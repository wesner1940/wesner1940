Had a non-productive session lerning Obsidian. Bryan Jenks is good, but I find his speed talking and speed navigating hard to follow. I'm guessing he's making  a lot of assumptions about his viewers. I think it's more obvious to me what teachers (whether trained or natural) do...they break things down.
I did get the Kindle/Bookcision/Obsidian pathway worked out
	1.  With the Kindle notes open use Bookcision to 	
		a. Download as text and edit
		b. Copy to clipboard
	2. If 1a. copy/paste into Obsidian
	3. If 1b. copy/past into Obsidian and edit.
Need to go back and read [[Fantasyland- Kurt  Anderson]] and take notes. It is a window into the insanity that has gripped our culture, its history and current manifestations.
Also need to figure out templates, how to use, how to make..Check Antonie

Got a source code for iframes and it works! (at least for youtube videos). Test tomorrow with podcast. Would be great if that works. Easy to make notes within Obsidian.

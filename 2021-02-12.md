- [ ] Had a new idea for some research today reading an article from the Atlantic...[[Looking Backward. How the GOP Tried to...]] from some future time at the outcomes of the GOP efforts. This might also include looking at  [[Delphi]]Delphi ( Still getting the hang of the editing tools).

Learning curves are a bitch.
Anyhow, having an indoor adventure with George in the bonus room yesterday provided a lesson. Gut and butt...both were sore this morning from squatting and kneeling with him on the floor for an hour or more. Tells me I need to do more.

Maisie continues to warm up requiring me to read her books (many books!).
I plan to go up today to deliver the Christmas tree and retrieve my cell phone.
- [ ] Also need to follow up on my Obsidian learning process notes from yesterday and finish the [[Sam Harris-Divided Mind]].
Decided to keep this open in case I have more ideas to add today.

Writing after a day in Milford. Also delivered t-posts and other metal to store behind the pole barn. Need to keep the shuttle going.
Just let Wll know we're good for lodgings this summer. Hopefully, we'll sell by then, but if not we're going to stay at Mags. Won't be a vacaton.

Heard some good things, oddly enough on Sam Harris' interview with Ricky Gervais, but will have to review. Need to get these things down early of keep my tape recorder handy.

Need to get back to early writing tomorrow. Will walk with Bob Smith also.

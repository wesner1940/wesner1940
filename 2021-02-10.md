So I just ran into this coming up on my day.
Kind of lazy start due to an overnight headache. Linda give me an ibuprofin and I slept through almost 3 podcasts. Woke up to hear Elon Musk use the term catalytic value in regard to his Tesla. business. Folds into my interest in catalyst. Can't remember the context buy I heard this used the other day and am kind of fixing on it. Musk was saying his Tesla continues to have catalytic value so he'll stay with it.

Moving on to today's work. Will continue to learn and use Obsidian. It;s kind of interesting that using the program has already made me write more than I ever have (at least in the last 40 years). Am also pursuing the place of Obsidian in a total KMS system (use Drafts and other software as a kit with Obsidian). Also will finish up notes with Sam Harris interview with Iain McGischrist on the[[Sam Harris-Divided Mind]]Divided Mind. I'm thinking a good project will be to go back to my old notes on the split brain and integrate Mc's understanding particularly since he emphasizes the right brain's expansive functioning (it's the master and the right the emissarly).

Spent more of the morning reviewing Dirose's workflow [[JustinDirose'ss workflow]] workflow andNick Milo's [[Plugins-Nick Milo]]

Good report at Hopkins. Sorry to see Tejwani go. He will pass me off to a new person who is going to be attached to a unit located downtown.

Thinking about calculus. I never had to take it and probably would have been afraid to. All my engineer friends took it an struggled with it. This thought came to me as I heard about a Korean girl enrolled at Phillips Exeter in New Hampshire, but living in Seoul due to COVID who won a 250,000 award for developing a dating application which uses a universe (as opposed to defined) population to do its matching. Obviously has many applications (e.g. organ donors), but I wonder what tools she used to do this. Was it calculus and if it was how come all my engineer friends didn't do this long ago....a puzzle. I'm left in the meantime wondering what calculus is, did she use it, and if not what tools she did use to come up with her application/algorithm.

Also ran into a bibliography for Nassem Talib's work. Looks intersting. I need to pursue. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ta6bprTcILxKRIbcynf1hUHVDb5cVxQZPnt4XCcMO2o/edit#heading=h.n8uvz7lhm3zf

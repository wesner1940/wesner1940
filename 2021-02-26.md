Up early to get LIPIE panel testing.
Listening to NPR about the Texas storm and its aftermath. They were commenting on the problems of the Texas energy system which is basically unregulated with control in the hands of the energy companies. The problem according to NPR is that the energy companies could winterize their production facilities, but it would cost a huge amount to do so (this cutting into their profits). However the cost to the businesses that are shut down and thus to the state is probably much more than that figure. So this is another example of the "Tragedy of the Commons" in which the profit of the few is detrimental to the welfare of the many. Garrett Hardin would be proud to have seen this coming!

Think I've solved my typing problem by elevating and tilting the keyboard.

Download and set upMilo's LYT Kit, but will need to spend some time on it.

Also need to start taking loads to Milford, beginning with shelving. Need to set up so that I can take up other tools and materials before taking on the drywalling and shelving.

Test note to see if sync is on

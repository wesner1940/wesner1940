Was in Milford today. Am feeling tired as a result. Linda got her 1st shot today. Mag had some reaction from yesterday. Didnt' get much done aside from running interference for Mag and Linda. Good day for getting things done.
Also looked at iCloud as a way of depositing my Obsidian entries. Looks likek it might work if I set the Obsidian vault on the icloud server. Later found a problem. iCloud does't allow folders to be uploaded. You can create folders, but the Obsidian changes would not go into them, e.g. the Daily folder.

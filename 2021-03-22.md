Got fouled up in navigation. Solution was to open another vault.
Start of new week. Lots of tasks.

As I flesh out my interests in Obsidian, I find myself moving backward in time to my earlier interests in education and more specifically, how our education is wrong. Open schooling at its basis is true, it just couldn't be implemented within the structure of top down education models. I have run into [[Deutsch]] and [[Gopnick]] who make the case for philosophical, psychological and political educational reform. The emergence of technology as a facilitator, as well as modeler (many of the successful technology innovators are deducts and school dropouts.) provide the possibility of alternatives to "prison" schooling.

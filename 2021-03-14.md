Sunday, first day of DST. Slow start to day as I was watching clips of the NCAA indoor championships.
Agenda for today includes trying to drag the front yard for leaves and branches. Also calling Ty and Alfredo to see if they would contract.
Weather to go back to cool spring pattern for the week.

From the house where I lived for a time, there was a tree in the distance toward the east which I could see from my upstairs window and I would measure the days and seasons by the sun's location with reference to it. Beyond and around the tree were little beaches houses with the bay beyond. I wonder if the tree has survived the surrender of those little cottages to the bedecked beach mansions which have replaced them.

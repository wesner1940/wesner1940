>I'm somewhat confused listening to Brett Weinstein and Jordan Peterson' podcast. They are arguing for merit, and self responsibility. Their beef is with people who want to change the system, but not assume self responsibility for their own improvement. They also posit a vast educational conspiracy which is promoting the idea(s) that the system is corrupt and should be overturned/fixed. They also point out the ridiculous situations like the b=Boston gifted schools closing down because of lack of diversity, which in effect punishes the students who are "meritorious". These are kind of straw man tactics to win their point. They put up the idea that merit itself is a corrupt idea. I don't know anyone who holds that rather stupid idea or should...it doen't make sense. "If you admit to competence, you admit to hierarchy". "The war on competence..the pathological end to the current culture war." Again...when a straw man is used, we may need to look for the real reason it is being employed. How long will it take us (given we come to our sense) to get back to the level of competence we were headed for?BW
>These two are arguing for us to value competence (and therefor hierarchy), but neglect that the power structure prevents it from happening. It is easy to say "pull yourself up by your bootstraps", but hard to do if you don't have any boots. Secondly, they seem to be arguing for the status quo in that the people on top of the hierarchy are there by their own efforts, even while admitting that there is corruption due to power inequities. "The degradation of the system by people who didn't believe in competence in the first place goes back decades-BW". We have access to the data that proves this-JP...I have data that claims that getting the right answer (and not showing your work) is indicative of white supremacist bias....I don't know if this is true or the extent to which it is true (but he just put it out there). BW says there is sampling bias everywhere, but this reporting was funded by the Gates Foundation..."which tells you something" (and proves its validity)?... and it's back by many school boards and I've seen it pop up in the tweets of many superintendents All of these tropes about racism and merit are a trap because as soon as you object, it proves you are racist. Every parent i know (in US and CA) with kids in school is facing that school passing on information about history and inequality. it is taking place in schools of ed., board rooms and in corporations.JP-they have no idea of what kind of fifth column they are allowing to emerge and how pernicious that will be.JP it's guilt (causing this)..but it shouldn't be because what predicts success business (and science) is hard work & ethics and intelligence.(Does this sound like an supporter/apologist?) It is ubiquitous, it is in every college (esp. colleges of education), corporations, HS, and all major media (with the exception of Wall St. Journal and Fox News)!!!! Good lord, the cat just tore the bag apart. It seems to be accelerating. Red Scare!!!

Loaded up tposts and wood for movement to Milford. Amazing how many projects I started and didn't finish or had the material for and didn't materialize.

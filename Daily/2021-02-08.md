Third day without a drink. I don't feel much different. Have had a hard time getting to sleep both nights. We'll see how it goes. Upside is I won't have as much difficulty with my second vaccine shot (hopefully).
I checked on the effects of the second shot.  They are much worse and occur in more people. However, not everyone has the secondary effects. Need to talk to Tejwani to make a plan.

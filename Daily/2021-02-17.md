Good day. Dryer hooked up, faucet fixed. Contracted to replace floor in bathroom and molding put down and do a run through to prepare for house showing. Scott Forsman and his son will also help with putting up dry wall and insulation in the pole barn. Good day.
Contacted Maren and then Alicia about Maren being on phone plan. Alicia says she doesn't have the $ and has lost her phone for behavior violation lately. Gave her (my) old phone to a friend who wasn't supposed to have one.
I'm going to prune the blueberries this afternoon and get started on some of the other shrubs as well as finishing my step exercise stairs. Got bills paid this am.

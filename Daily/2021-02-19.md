Got an early start today..7:00. Searched mail to see if Beebe had sent my 2nd vaccine notice. No luck. I did read that the 2nd should not be given before 28 days which will be on the 23rd for me.
Another bleak day, freezing rain this am to change to cold rain later. This may turn out to be a record spring rain season. Lots of water standing around the house.

Will start today checking on Obsidian related software, Zotero. Also need to check on a better keyboard. Got Bookcision started and downloaded notes on The Dark Side by Jane Mayer about the post 9/11 government response.(Need to go back and check thses notes. All of them didn't get recorded.)

Zotero looks really good. Got tired though looking at and figuring how to use it.

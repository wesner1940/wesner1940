Worked mostly on developing my [[Home]] MOC for exercise this morning.
Had a good thought for worm catching this am. punch holes in a plastic container, put food in it and bury in the bin. Wait a few days and check to see if works have accumulated. Would be a good method for harvesting the castings without the worms.
Having trouble with formatting Obsidian. Need to go back and review how to set up links and backlinks. Started to set up tags and worked on general map.

Ran into problems with increasing and decreasing resolution. Solution was in the View. Downloaded a cheat sheet with space for more hotkeys. Finished No. 7 of the Huberman tape series. Need to actualize his advice. Actually am doing this with learning Obsidian, although I'm not following the incremental, short term focus approach.

Headed for Milford today with a big load of shelving. 
Ran into a lot of ideas this morning after contemplating the type energy to use in the new house. Listened to NPR clip on gas vs. electri and became aware of the efforts of energy companies to get home owners to use natural gas, but that it has serious environmental an health issues. (a gas kitchen stove produces nitrous oxide which causes allergies and asthma in kids.) Advice is to go electric. So my next move is to evaluate solar vs.geothermal. One advantage of solar is that it produces not just heating and cooling but also energy for other needs (like lighting and cooking). Then there's also the ROI issue. 'another factor would be escalating costs of electric clauses like those that' Texans faced in the 2021 winter storm.
Ran into some related ideas in Dave Perell's cast today (OODA). See article particularly as it applies to building our house.

Also had a notion about the funding business plans of podcasts I listen to these days...the practice of subscrptions. A given individaul like myself cannot afford to contribute to all the requests we get from podcasts, even though we enjoy and learn from a variety of them. The practice of joining together for one subscription price may be the way to go, but the consistency of individual casts make this iffy.Luminary is only $36 per year, but I wouldn't listen to most of the podcasts. I contribute 2x that to Sam Harris, bu listen to at least 3/4 of his casts. Obviously I can't justify expanding the budget that much. I also subscribe to the Atlantic. I don't know what a better model would be, but I think a 'per use/listen' fee might be better for the consumer and producer, who would be motivated to produce better products for the audience, which is already defined.

See Carl Schmitt article...foundation of modern politics is religion, not the enlightenment.???

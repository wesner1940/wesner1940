It might be just as well that I lost a couple of days notes. First, I will be sure to do double back ups of everything I do in Obsidian and second, I will re-orient how I take notes. When watching the Huberman video, I was trying to get down everything of importance he was saying. In the future, I'll stop the video and make an interpretive note to the important points...acting on the information which seems to be more effective in retention and understanding.

Jumped around a lot this a.m. Got into workspaces on Obsidian and wasted a lot of time on youtube. See below and practice

Found my previoius work in another vault in Documents/Home, transferred the additions to this vault and copied to my desktop.

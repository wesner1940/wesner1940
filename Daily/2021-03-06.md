Workied on learning markdown in the context of taking notes. Running into little glitches like setting up url's in notes to outside links (solved that), but stilll can't move the link after I insert. A lot of little things to learn.

Still cold (high of 42 today), but better weather coming next week.
Am getting better at sleep, but still wake up at frequent intervals, although I seem to be on a 3 hr. spell now, up from every 2 hours. Need to look into methods and assists (Huberman mentioned magnesiium triticate?)

From a short dream session aroun 4a..m.Dreaming that we were not invited to a party at Pat's (or somewhere) that included a number of people we knew and were friends with as well as some new people we liked. Suddenly I became aware of a fire starting in back of Pat's house and immediately ran over with a hose and started quenching it, but it grew larger faster. I was calling to everyone in the house to come and help fight the fire as it continued to grow, but no one come out. The fire just grew larger as I woke up. ...What to make of that?

Listening to Andrew Huberman on brain plasticity...given that the adrenal glands produce epinephrine (as does the brain), what effect on my behavior is produced by the fact that my adrenals are not functioning properly? Is it the brain production that produces the alarm response?

From another podcast (?). The power of a leader derives from the consent of the governed....the consent of the governed.

The sugar/alcohol connection. I find that I still need something at the end of the day...the role that alcohol played until a month ago. One month in I find that consuming sugar based stuff (ice cream, soda, etc.) reduces and even takes the place of the alcohol "need".

Off to visit and walk with Bob this morning. First real outing since last Mar. 12, the day after the WHO declared a pandemic and the last day of my social "instancing" for the past year with my last class at Mispillion. Quite a year in most people's experience, not so much for me and Linda. Like she says, "we were built for a pandemic".

Goebels? If you want people to do anything authoritarisn or democratic, make them afraid. Chomsky points out the need for guns in the US and Krauass points out the fear we have about children being on their own. The dangers back then ion the past we far greater. Trump knows what he is doing (and Bannon in AZ meeting to raise wall money and the donors are frightened)

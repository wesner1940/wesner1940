A very gray day. Rain in the pm. Got feedback from Ty today. Wish I had gotten it early on. He's got a good eye and expertise. Launching into the construction process with trepidation. Not knowing about building processes is a handicap, but maybe I can learn something. Need to get Josh involved in planning the electric.
Committed to raku firing with Lawrence and Jenna. Will work out becausse it will force me to fire all my inventory.
Off to Hopkins tomorrow to have my last visit with Tejwani. Seems like a long way to go for a 1/2 hour meeting, but I guess it best to maintain my connection. He said he would get a hand off set up.
Need to start shifting info from Notion and Evernote, particularly some of the writing I've started. Also need to start some writing topics. Maybe such as "getting started in ceramics", "how to raise a boy","running as meditation"

Another Sat. I thought, but it is Friday. Wasted? time this morning running down ITP and looking at my mail in all its diversity, There is just too much stuff out there, I need to learn to ignore.
Think I'm recovering from my day with the kids yesterday. Really wore me out...out of practice or out of shape.
So the headlight on the Prius went out. Just happened to see it as Linda pulled in the other day. How long was it out? How long would it have been before we discovered it? Chance. Am getting more and more aware of chance. (and choice).

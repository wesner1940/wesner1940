Up to get ready for visit to Hopkins.

A metaphor - burning ships #metaphors

	-by the company to keep us from going elsewhere..or going home
	-by us to show our resolve to succeed, no matter what comes

Started in on taxes yesterday, spent the whole afternoon. Much frustration, not being able to solve software problems.

Got started in shotgun mode this a.m. Looking for workshop set up advice, checked mail and Beebe vaccine info, moved on to Obsidian notes, wandered off into a Sam Harris video, and did the spirograph (close to 2700 avg). Am getting ready for PFT on Mar. 1. Not altogether productive, but hit some check boxes. Next plan to develop an Obsidian cheat sheet.
Also sent Donna some Popova refs. Think she'll relate to what Popova puts out.
Checking my daily tasks I see that I have to go out in the cold rain (miserable day, Linda was off as Josh couldn't go to work, weather too bad).
Have been checking out items for my Obsidian workflow. So far, Notion looks best for gathering web info, Drafts for copying, converting to MD and then copy/paste to Obsidian. Also checked how to get Kindle quotes (via Text Edit) and Airr snippets, but need to get them into a smooth flow.
Started looking for workshop shelves/layouts and planning.
Checked out Yinote. couldn't find a way to download in MD. Am thinking I'll just listen to videos on old computer and take notes directly in Obsidian.Raindrop looks like it has possibilities. Need to check out Zotero.

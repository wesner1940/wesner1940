Getting late so I'm just entering to keep the rhythm going. Did a lot of research on Obsidian today. Left learning how to put vertical connectors in outlines until tomorrow, but I think I'm starting to get how to add scripts. Am really getting a lot from Heureka (Matt) in terms of actually working on text with various commands. Seems like having something to work on works better in terms of learning. He also doesn't jump all over the place while explaining, but he is a professor. My term now for the tech guyms trying to explain their stuff is RCM (Rapid Cursor Movements) and RSM (Rapid Speech Movements). It is amazing how fast they talk...must be a brain thing.

Need to continue my cheat sheet. and do the vertical lines tomorrow.

Did get outside to measure all my tool spaces for the Pole Barn shop. And Richard Tikiob called out of the blue.

Got my 2nd COVID shot today. Just a sore arm so far. Off to Milford tomorrow for our adventures. Hope to get G. looking at the Curiosity Strean vids also now that they have decent reception.
